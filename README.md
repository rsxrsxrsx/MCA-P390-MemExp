# MCA-P390-MemExp
DIY memory expansion board for MicroChannel P/390 systems. A collaborative effort between members of a private IBM hobbyist Discord to (potentially) expand the memory capacity of the P/390.

We are hoping to determine first if the P/390 is capable of addressing >128MB of memory. From there, we hope to produce design files for a replacement memory expansion board that will allow for users to expand the amount of memory available to their P/390. An 8GB P/390 running MVS/ESA? One can dream... :)
